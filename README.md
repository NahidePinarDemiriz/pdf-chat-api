# PDF Chat API

PDF Chat API is a FastAPI application that allows users to upload and chat with PDF files. This project demonstrates the integration of external services (e.g., LLM API like Google Gemini) and efficient PDF content extraction for interactive conversations.
Project Overview

This project showcases a RESTful API where users can:

    Upload PDF documents.
    Query a chat interface to ask questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.

## Features

    Upload PDFs: Efficiently upload and store PDFs while extracting their text and metadata.
    LLM Integration: Use Google Gemini API (or other LLMs) to process natural language queries based on the PDF content.
    State Management: Store the extracted text, manage sessions, and maintain a robust error handling mechanism.
    Scalability: Optimized for large PDFs and concurrent requests.
